              My name is Joe and I am a London-based JavaScript Developer.
              I started learning Web Development a few years ago and I have a
              diverse set of skills ranging from design to development. I have
              a good eye for beautiful and clean design, but my one true love
              is JavaScript. I love JavaScript and everything that comes with it,
              from the client-side to the server-side of the language, my
              appreciation for Javascript keeps growing day by day
